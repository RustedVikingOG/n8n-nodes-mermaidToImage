## üîÑ MANDATORY SYNC PROTOCOL

1. Before making changes read the current [.docs/ai/templates/*.md].

2. Before making changes read the current docs in [.docs/designs/architecture.md] and [.docs/designs/use_cases.md] designs of the current solution.

3. read and follow the [.docs/1.COLLABORATION.md] and analyze the project code.

4. Update/write all required documentation to [.docs/designs/*.md] for the current solution.

5. Evaluate the completeness of the required documentation in [.docs/designs/*.md] as fully describing the current solution.

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Rules

- ‚úÖ Provide explicit app specific descriptions of systems, functionality within the app.
- ‚úÖ with mermaid diagrams, any multi word names with spaces are quoted to avoid the compilation errors. Especially those containing parenthesis i.e. My awesome app (Awesome Name) -> "My awesome app (Awesome Name)".
- ‚ùå Never provide generic / general explainations on the functionality of systems described.
- ‚ùå don't add escaped comments within mermaid diagrams. If you would like to note a change or highlight something, add a comment after the diagram as a note.
